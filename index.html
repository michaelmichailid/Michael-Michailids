    <h1><font color=white>Why We Remember!</font></h1>
     <p><font color=white> Why do we remember? We remember because there are people that fought for our freedom. We Remember because people died so we could have peace. Think of that, someone died so we could live happy without having to worry about a bomb blowing up the city or people attacking the city with guns. On July 28th 1914 World War 1 started. This is when all the horror and tragedies started. World War 1 ended on November 11th 1918. That is why we have a moment of silence on November 11th 1918. World War 2 is also one of the most brutal wars in history.</font></p>
